# helmet_detection_AI_project
A Computer Vision solution for automatic safety compliance in real-time video streams  traffic. Achieved high 98% accuracy by precisely distinguishing safety helmets from non-compliant headwear (caps). Features bounding box visualization, confidence scores, and robust performance in varied lighting.
